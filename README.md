## Middleman Playground

Feel free to do whatever you like.

Please [checkout a new Branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) and commit your work there.

### Middleman basics:

`bundle` - installs all gems and their dependancies from 'Gemfile'
`middleman` or `middleman server` starts the [server at port 4567](http://localhost:4567).
Stop the service by pressing `ctrl + C` in your terminal.
